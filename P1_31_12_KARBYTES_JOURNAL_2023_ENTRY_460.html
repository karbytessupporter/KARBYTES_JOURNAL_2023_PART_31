<p>The following GitHub repository has been created today by karbytes to store files which pertain to the revised version of karbytes&#8217; primary website (and those revisions are currently being implemented at the time <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_459/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this journal entry</a> web page was published (and substantial revisions are expected to be made to that website between the dates of 12_JUNE_2023 and 01_AUGUST_2023)). That new GitHub repository has the following description and a hyperlink to the home page of karbytes&#8217; primary website (which is <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>):</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00"><em>This repository contains web page source code and media files which constitute (some of (if not all of)) the intellectual property encapsulated by the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com.</em></span></p>
<p>The Uniform Resource Locator (i.e. URL (i.e. web page address)) of that GitHub repository is as follows: <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack</a></p>
<p>A new image was posted to karbytes&#8217; Instagram account (whose username is @karbytes_anew) by karbytes. That new image depicts Brea the cat sitting on a pedestal near the front door of the house which is karbytes&#8217; current legal address (and has been karbytes&#8217; legal address since May 2016 (and that address is <u>4757 Mira Vista Drive, Castro Valley, CA 94546</u>)).</p>
<p>The GitHub repository link to that specific image file is as follows: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_31/main/instagram_karbytes_12_june_2023_part_0.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_31/main/instagram_karbytes_12_june_2023_part_0.jpg</a></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">At this time karbytes is considering setting the following rules for coloring hyperlinks which are displayed in any of karbytes&#8217; personal websites: If the hyperlink leads to a single GitHub repository file, then make the background color of that hyperlink button black and set the text color to green if that file is a source code file (and if that file is a media file such as an image file, sound file, or video file, set the text color to orange). If the hyperlink leads to a web page within any of karbytes&#8217; personal websites, then make the background color of that hyperlink button orange if that hyperlink leads to a prose-dominant page (and make the background color of that hyperlink button green if that hyperlink leads to a code-dominant page) and set the text color to black. Otherwise, set the hyperlink background color to orange and set the text color to black.</span></p>
