<p>Today (before 4:00AM) I got the web pages of my primary website whose home page index numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 up to date (but 1 was already up to date and has been since 13_JUNE_2023 and 4 was already up to date and has been since 14_JUNE_2023).</p>
<p>Updated primary website pages:</p>
<p>1: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a></p>
<p>2: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/factorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FACTORIAL</a></p>
<p>3: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/fibonacci_numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIBONACCI_NUMBERS</a></p>
<p>4: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/golden_ratio_approximation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOLDEN_RATIO_APPROXIMATION</a></p>
<p>5: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NUMBERS</a></p>
<p>I decided that I will not bother removing social media posts from my social media profiles which link to obsolete web pages of my primary website.</p>
<p>I decided also that I will keep my journaling about personal issues to a bare minimum.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I would like to spend more of my time and energy studying mathematics because working out math problems alters my brain chemistry and makes me feel saner and less agitated. I liken doing math problems to be the mental equivalent of rigorous physical exercise. I ideally want to do both in order to be as smart, strong, sane, and healthy as I can be and to maintain a high degree of physical and mental fitness for the duration of what remains of my life to an extent which is feasible.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Lastly, I thought it would be a good investment for me to subscribe to eventually pay for a pro membership to use the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WolframAlpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WolframAlfa</a> online service because it provides detailed and mathematically accurate steb-by-step math problem solving features (with graphing and a lot of other science related study aids). I am currently using that website for unpaid services such as using it to verify whether a given input is an algebraic number.</span></p>
