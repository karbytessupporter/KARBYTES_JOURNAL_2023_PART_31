<p>When I arrived at my house today around 9PM, I noticed that the patio electrical outlets which I was using two nights ago were not working. Also, I noticed that my dad and his friends were having band practice in the garage (which I am glad for because I didn&#8217;t want to interact with people while I was trying to implement a workaround which would enable me to (a) charge my laptop, (b) access the house Wi-Fi on my laptop (using my phone as an intermediary because my laptop seems to have more trouble staying connected to Wi-Fi than does my phone, and (c) sit outside in the backyard. (Unfortunately, the patio is the only place in my dad&#8217;s backyard which provides a roof for shelter in the rain). I cut a small hole in the screen of my bedroom window using  the scissors I keep in my backpack. Then I connected the two surge protectors which I bought with wages earned from working as a package handler in Fremont, plugged them into the working wall outlet in my room, and fed the connected power surges through that hole in the screen. My laptop is plugged into a surge protector and charging now. So far I seem to have a working solution but, because I seem to be bullied at home, I intend to keep using my laptop mostly away from my parents&#8217; houses. Thankfully, I know where some local public electrical outlets are and have two portable power stations as backup to charge my laptop.</p>

<p>karbytes: &#8220;If you are bullied at home to the extent that people literally go out of their way to be passive aggressive to you and to cut you off from being able to use your laptop at home and given that you have places to go other than your dad&#8217;s house with electrical outlets and Wi-Fi, why do you even bother setting up your laptop at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I do not want to be overly reliant on public places and I do not want to be cut off from being able to benefit from having a place of legal residence. I do not like being forced to live like I am homeless against my will. This is my way of making sure I do not feel cheated out of having nice things which I would otherwise not have if I, like a goody two shoes, said nothing about the abuse which is inflicted on me and simply stayed outside my house 24/7 while holding down a full-time job or else actively looking for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Do you think that the people trying to discourage you from working from home are trying to help you be more independent?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I would say yes to be charitable, but I would also so no because my bullies seem to be opposed to me being resourceful and good tempered and on top of my priorities. If they wanted me to thrive in the world, I think they would not resort to passive aggression and acting opposed to my goals (especially my goals pertaining to building my websites and advancing my science, engineering, and mathematics knowledge). I am trying to &#8216;beat them at their own game&#8217; (if that is the game they are playing) by not letting their shitty behavior cause me to be shitty to myself and others. I want to show myself and others that it is possible to be successful if one is resourceful and determined enough even if one lacks social support from family or even friends. Thanks to the Internet and the fact that I live next to Silicon Valley, I think I will have no problem making friends who share my geeky interests when I feel ready to do so. Before I go out and socialize at geeky gatherings, I first want to get my primary website&#8217;s summer update done and also get a paid job so that I can pay for things like tickets to attend conventions and to pay for my hobbies which my family does not exactly seem supportive of me having.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Why do you think your parents are unsupportive of your hobbies?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I think they disapprove of me pursuing my hobbies because doing so proves that I am not as mentally ill as they insist I am. I think they benefit from making people think I am too mentally ill to be taken seriously and someone who is to be treated like a public burden so that they have someone to ridicule in place of having to look inwards and come to terms with how little they do besides watch television and gossip idly.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid you&#8217;ll get punished for disclosing such unflattering thoughts about your family?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Not really. I figure I am damned if I do and damned it I don&#8217;t. No matter how hard I try to not talk about other people in ways which make them look bad, people still seem to bully me and try to get me to have some kind of freak out so that they can have me locked up in prison or in a mental hospital or, perhaps most generally of all, be too upset too often to work on my personal goals (which pertain to my hobbies especially). Also, I don&#8217;t like being someone who keeps things which are relatively important a secret merely to be loyal to one&#8217;s abusers. If it were more of a matter of life or death or of avoiding getting physically beaten up, I would still disclose what happens to me because it might be the last thing I do and help criminal investigators and historians figure out what happened to me when I disappeared or ended up a bloody lifeless carcass somewhere.&#8221;</p>
