<p>Within the past 24 hours I think I broke my personal record for how dehydrated I would allow myself to become. I procrastinated on refilling my water bottles and ended feeling a distinct kind of full-body pain which felt like not being able to sweat, not being able to salivate, and feeling shaky and weak in my muscles while walking towards the water fountain about half a mile away from my campsite. It was about 1:30PM and the past two days have been rather hot and bright. As I packed up my belongings, donned my heavy backpack, and started walking to the water fountain (drinking water, of course), I told myself not to panic when in a life or death emergency and to pretend I&#8217;m not having an emergency so that I don&#8217;t have a heart attack or make my situation worse. It seems to help me a lot to think of myself as a soldier on a risky mission because doing so compels me to be as strong and resourceful as I can be instead of freaking out and relatively helpless. I would only call 911 if I thought I did not have the means to save myself in some kind of emergency where grave bodily harm was eminent.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel better now that I got some water in me (and have been drinking it slowly and steadily throughout the afternoon) and I also forced myself to eat some food (because I had not eaten since 6AM in the morning the day prior). I also bought a small strong coffee and slowly drank the whole thing. I have been lying down in the shade and slowly regaining my normal energy levels. I feel almost back to normal.</p>
<p>While laying down I imagined having my own <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilium_Jet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lilium</a> to summon which is driven by a robot chauffeur and which picks me up and drops me off at places I ask it to so that I don&#8217;t have to walk so much nor pollute nor be confined to roads and trails (and the Lilium is a self driving aircraft which is entirely powered by electricity and which has the ability to take off and land vertically like a helicopter does as well as carry seven human passengers).</p>
