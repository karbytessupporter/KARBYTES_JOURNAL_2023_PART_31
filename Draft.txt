When I arrived at my house today around 9PM, I noticed that the patio electrical outlets which I was using two nights ago were not working. Also, I noticed that my dad and his friends were having band practice in the garage (which I am glad for because I didn't want to interact with people while I was trying to implement a workaround which would enable me to (a) charge my laptop, (b) access the house Wi-Fi on my laptop (using my phone as an intermediary because my laptop seems to have more trouble staying connected to Wi-Fi than does my phone, and (c) sit outside in the backyard. (Unfortunately, the patio is the only place in my dad's backyard which provides a roof for shelter in the rain). I cut a small hole in the screen of my bedroom window using  the scissors I keep in my backpack. Then I connected the two surge protectors which I bought with wages earned from working as a package handler in Fremont, plugged them into the working wall outlet in my room, and fed the connected power surges through that hole in the screen. My laptop is plugged into a surge protector and charging now. So far I seem to have a working solution but, because I seem to be bullied at home, I intend to keep using my laptop mostly away from my parents' houses. Thankfully, I know where some local public electrical outlets are and have two portable power stations as backup to charge my laptop.
