While I'm on the subject ot women's issues (and trying to finish up so that my blog can move onto topics which I enjoy more and which I think are more worthy of my time), I felt the need to mention that some women (and some non women) have expressed antagonism and envy at me because, unlike those people, I have a genuine love of mathematics and computer science which is not forced nor something I do primarily to earn other people's approval. (I do think all humans innately have a natural inclination to inquire about how things work but socialization indoctrinates humans to eventually only value something as the means to the end of attaining social approval or the means to survive). The people who whine and chastise me when I work on projects or activities which pertain to studying mathematics or computer science or physics (and actually enjoy it) seem to believe that I need to be mentally conditioned against wanting to pursue such endeavors and, also, to acquire crippling anxiety and malaise about pursuing such endeavors so that I, like them, settle for doing the bare minimum to survive and to earn social approval to the people who live in proximity to me or who raised me or who I depend on for economic and physical security. Otherwise, I am being a white male supremacist, elitist, and inappropriately aristocratic instead of demonizing of white men in general, populist, and appropriately peasant like in my thoughts and conduct. I am afraid there are people working day and night diligently to destroy my love of and proficiency in academics (especially science, mathematics, and engineering subjects) so that I am relegated to poverty and only low-paying, low-skilled jobs solely to keep those people from feeling jealous of what would be my relatively "privileged" existence and from feeling insecure about how little they enjoy and are proficient at those aforementioned subjects. Hell, even being articulate and relatively disaffected in the face of adversity is a threat to those people for the same reasons. Hence, they seem opposed to me being able to cope with adversity and not use adversity as an excuse to act ineffective. Such people seem to strongly prefer that, much more like how they would in stressful situations, be more histrionic, miserable, and irrational; more easily discouraged and more willing to give up on trying to pursue ambitious goals because they think I should only do something if enough people with enough approval from others approve of me doing whatever that thing is. Basically, I am being tried as a delinquent for the crime of doing things without sufficient permission, approval, and support from other people.

"Women never feel engulfed. Women feel lonely when not surrounded by other people at all times. Women live solely to relate to other people. On their own, women feel nonexistent, unimportant, and directionless."

Apparently what I wrote is so offensive to whoever is surveilling me that they hacked my phone to prevent me from having mobile Internet access (despite the signal strength indicator suggesting I have decent connectivity).

Apparently, I am being forcibly censored as punishment for "making women feel bad".

"I wanted to cut you off in the middle of what you are doing in order to make you feel depressed and so that you don't get anything done more than what we get done. We want you to spend all your free time cleaning up after whoever abuses you."

I noticed my phone connectivity was cut off a few minutes after packing up my tent at approximately 1:30AM because "my spidy senses" have been telling me to put it back in my closet to practice camping closer to BART stations and in locations which are close to where I expect to be working because it takes me a long time (at least one hour in one direction) to travel to and from (by foot) where I was camping the past few weeks and places which seem like more ideal camping spots if my goal is to get to work on time and to have at least an hour or free time to work on my laptop. 

I'm not sure I will be able to do that if the government (or whoever) permanently cut me off from being able to use my phone. I noticed that I can't even use my phone right now to make non-emergency phone calls because, according to error messages, my phone is apparently no longer registered with any telecommunications network. It would be hard for me to get a job without a working cell phone. I refuse to stay confined to my parents' houses just to take phone calls.

I noticed that I was able to make non emergency phone calls and access websites via the Chrome browser app (only very briefly) which is part of my Android phone's native operating system once I walked far enough down the road. My phone's cellular network connectivity indicator has been graphically depicting weaker signal strength than usual for this area. AT&T (which is my phone's service provider) and/or hackers are probably to blame for this major reduction in service quality.

The non emergency phone number I was calling to test my phone's network connectivity was the California EBT food stamps hotline because it is answered by a robot instead of by a human. I only call humans for specific pragmatic reasons and such phone calls are quite rare.

In closing this note, I wanted to mention that one of the main reasons why I thought about leaving that campsite and putting my tent away (but still sleeping outdoors using my backpack as a pillow and doing almost all my computer usage outdoors) is because pig_gorl seems extra difficult for me to put up with in remote locations which are far away from amenities which are only convenient to walk to in more urban places like the 24 hour gas station and connected convenience store named Cox (which has public bathrooms) within a quarter mile radius of East Dublin BART (which also happens to be within a reasonable walking distance of many public electrical outlets and a public shopping center Wi-Fi network). I used to practically live there. I might go back to living there especially once I start working as a paid employee again.

One last thing (hopefully): it has been brought to my attention by the thought police that I was (and apparently still am) being punished for "making women feel like the center of attention (and dumb) instead of letting them go back to work". 

If I stop talking about women's issues (or women as a group) or if I stop talking about gender issues (or gender as a topic) forever after this blog post, it is to avoid getting further punished and, also, to move onto what I think are more primary website relevant topics.
