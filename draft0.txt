While walking I was thinking about something I have written about in past journal entries and that I would like to reiterate in clearer terms: as medical technology advances, human lifespans will likely have the capacity to be extended orders of magnitude what they currently are (but only if the following measures are taken): most humans will need to prioritize extending individual human lifespans over maintaining or increasing human population size (and most humans will need to need to believe that allowing scientific and technological research and development to continue with minimal obstruction is far more beneficial to humanity than detrimental).

I think that many humans rather automatically react in opposition to what I suggested because such people believe that allowing technology to become any more advanced than it currently is will (a) enable artificial intelligence to become too smart and powerful for humans to control, (b) that such artificial intelligence will enslave, harm, or kill humans, (c) upset God and His ordained societal order because He does not like it when humans "play God" and make God feel ignored, replaced, diminished, and disobeyed, and (d) cause widespread existential anxiety and despair in humans who are strongly attached to and dependent on the tradition of the rite of passage which entails getting married to a suitable partner of the opposite sex as soon as possible and sexually reproducing to create as many offspring as possible within the context of that monogamous relationship and church and state sactioned institution called marriage.

I would like to elaborate on point d in the previous paragraph by saying that I think many humans are not sufficiently concerned with the welfare of any being other than themselves, their spouses, and their minor children (which means that such people do not think about how their actions impact the world outside that limited spatial and temporal scope (which means that such people are likely to contribute to overpopulation and to harming Earth's ecosystem)). Such people probably console themselves with the belief that they and their loved ones will be whisked away to eternal paradise and be reunited in the afterlife where that paradise exists (which means that it is a waste of their time to try saving Earth's ecosystem from becoming inhospitable to future human inhabitants).
