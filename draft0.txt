The real zombie apocalypse is what I call the asshole disease (which appears to be contagious). When one is surrounded by assholes, one is simply expected to succumb to becoming just another asshole. I have fallen ill with the disease at times but not enough to seriously be infected to my core. I have been trying not to turn into an asshole despite being frequently engulfed by assholes who seem to be chasing me around, stalking me, and sabotaging my fun so that I give up on being a cool person and, instead, settle for being an uncool person so that I can survive in the midst of tyrannical assholes who seem to monopolize the world and hastening the decline of civilization. Even though the prospects of the human species seems bleak as a result of that fact that the assholes are extremely numerous and momentous and set in their ways, I nevertheless try to make the most of the fear years left I have to live turning away from the cynical, belligerent, misery mongering assholes and towards the relatively few non assholes; the only people who don't seem to squander and human potential which took evolution millions if not billions of years to erect only to be squandered within less than one hundred years following the industrial revolution. I operate on larger time frames than the assholes who seem to think humans only existed for a few hundred years and mostly with the trappings bestowed by the industrial age. Just because other people are assholes does not necessarily mean that I will become an asshole, but it will probably mean that I will never be nearly as happy and healthy as I thought I would be. In order for humanity to not squander its abundance of resources and knowledge and abilities in the madness of modernity, a huge critical mass of humans would need to be sufficiently "woke" instead of sleepwalking while apparently awake in a trance driven by insecurity and animosity.

This is just propaganda from beyond. I am merely channeling someone else's messages such that they may be delivered to you. That's all the tabloids I have to share for now. I hope this helps.
