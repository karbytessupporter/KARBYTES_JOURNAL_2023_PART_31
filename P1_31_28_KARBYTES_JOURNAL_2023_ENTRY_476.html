<p>I remember one of my college professors from Chabot Community College saying (in a darkly humorous manner) that, if someone has already discovered an algorithm for decrypting all encrypted messages, that person probably has been abducted and locked up in a basement by the government such that the person&#8217;s location and that person&#8217;s discovery is hidden from the public.</p>
<p>I have many reasons based on things I&#8217;ve researched to not trust the United States government (or any government for that matter). Even though I don&#8217;t yet seem to be a &#8220;high profile&#8221; character with respect to society (because I have not apparently yet done anything remarkable and revolutionary on a large scale), I do think the government is trying to prevent me from becoming world famous and widely and radically influential through my work as a software developer and consciousness researcher so that I am used as someone to keep relatively unknown, unremarkable, and misunderstood so that people dismiss me as some kind of mentally ill, immature, vain, ignorant, and untalented person.</p>
<p>I noticed that people generally treat me like an idiot and some kind of delinquent who simply needs to stop sharing my intimate thoughts and feelings and personal beliefs and convictions on the Internet. People seem to be indifferent to what I write on the Internet and prefer to only talk to me like I&#8217;m some kind of child or pet who should be given the cold shoulder and treated like I&#8217;m only capable of worrying about my body&#8217;s upkeep and appearance and abiding by my parents&#8217; rules until and unless I show genuine interest in socialing with whoever is in my midst on those people&#8217;s terms and while also being indifferent to karbytes existence (because only Kar or Karlina is supposed to take residence in my body and mind and Kar or Karlina is supposed to be more humble, unworried, complacent, sociable, compliant with what the masses seem to want, sparsely worded, plain spoken, and idle). While walking down the street, I heard several people loudly bark as soon as I thought and wrote the word &#8220;vain&#8221; and some other self denigrating things as though those other people could hear my thoughts in real time. I seem to be the last person to be informed about what is going on and other people seem to be unwilling to disclose to me that they know what&#8217;s going on with respect to me being bullied and surveilled so pervasively seemingly in order to punish me for not shutting up and going back to work to earn enough money to pay my own rent.</p>
<p>Maybe that is what all this pig_gorl and civilians against karbytes drama is all about: using punitive means to softly evict me from my home and city of residence so that I work and live full time in some other town so that the residents of my home town can enjoy the peace of knowing I&#8217;m gone and no longer a burden for them to put up with.</p>
<p>(I think people withhold information from me and tell me misleading decoys and vague ad hominem put downs so that I am easier to manipulate and keep in a politically and socially weak position).</p>
<p>Perhaps I will never get along with people I know. Perhaps I will remain friendless for the rest of my life. Perhaps I&#8217;ll be relegated to living in squalor, poverty, and ongoing strife for the rest of my life. The people are winning because they greatly outnumber me. I might as well be dead to them already. This world belongs to them; not to me.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take me seriously. I&#8217;m mentally unstable and dumb. Don&#8217;t pay attention to anything I write. Just treat me like a body and nothing more. There. The End.</p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I think medical professionals (especially emergency medical professionals performing life-saving operations on people) are some of the most valuable members of society. In the jungle without modern civilization, people would die and otherwise suffer a lot more frequently from diseases and injuries which modern medicine can now relatively easily treat (and the technology is only getting better with time which means that average quality of life is expected to increase globally). Teachers are valuable members of society too, but with the advent of artificial intelligence, it is very easy and cheap for a person to be self taught at a variety of disciplines. Still, there is no substitute to hands on learning which is not just sitting behind a computer screen. Also, I think human staff at many places people go to for fun like restaurants, cafes, and museums will always be &#8220;in stock&#8221; because humans like the warmth and relatability of other humans. I am not worried that artificial intelligence is going to make the average quality of human life go down. I do not see it seriously being a threat to any human, in fact. Automation is not to blame for poverty and job loss. Humans are. It&#8217;s a matter of distribution of finite resources and understanding how every component of the economy (and ecosystem) is connected at a systems level. Machine intelligence is accelerating humans&#8217; ability to comprehend such things. I look forward to a future which gets better with every year for at least the next five thousand years.</span></p>
