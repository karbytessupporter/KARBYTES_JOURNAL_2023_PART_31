I imagined reaching the end of my life in old age and dying a slow and agonizing death as a result of preventable disease hastened by the negligence and socially normal cruelty of nursing home caregivers. I imagine having so few lasting human connections and so few humans championing my causes throughout my life that, unlike my more socially-connected and socially-supported counterparts, I would be relegated to the shittiest parts of the elder care business and essentially be treated as an unwanted and despised burden by others. 

Shouldn't my fear of getting mistreated, maligned, and neglected in old age spur me to more urgently ingratiate myself to others as their servant and ally? No. Quite the opposite. I resent the idea of me being subservient and unconditionally loyal to others just so that I do not get treated by my fellow humans as a "lost cause". 

What makes me feel much safer and more satisfied and in control of my life than depending on others is striving to be as self reliant and hardy as possible. That's something I seem to do which most others do not (and that's probably a major reason why other people seem to be showing me contempt for "showing off" how good I am at being self reliant and comfortable with spending almost all of my life in solitude and in the absence of people I know, trust, and feel valued by).

Again, to break out of that sniveling caricature of the bitter iconoclast I may have accidentally resurrected with this journal entry section, I often feel quite harmonious in the midst of other people in the sense that we can peacefully cohabitate on the same planet in the same region of that planet with no obvious conflicts arising. I also want to add that I generally do not feel safe carrying a lethal weapon nor carrying myself in a manner which suggests that I expect to engage in violent combat with other humans. I want humans to feel safe in my midst and to believe that I harbor zero intent to inflict violence on anyone except for in rare cases in which I need to protect myself or someone else from a violent attacker.

The coyotes are squealing and howling in unison loudly in the forest next to me. Now it's just the sound of creaking branches, rustling leaves, and distant train horns. Now comes the sound of a lone owl hooting. I also just now noticed crickets chirping. Then some raccoons made some chittering sounds as they scampered through the bushes. Frogs croaking come and go in waves. The forest is clearly teeming with life.
