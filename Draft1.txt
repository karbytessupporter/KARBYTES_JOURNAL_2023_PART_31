<span style="background:#ffff00">I think medical professionals (especially emergency medical professionals performing life-saving operations on people) are some of the most valuable members of society. In the jungle, people would die and otherwise suffer a lot more frequently from diseases and injuries which modern medicine can now relatively easily treat (and the technology is only getting better with time which means that average quality of life is expected to increase globally). Teachers are valuable members of society too, but with the advent of artificial intelligence, it is very easy and cheap for a person to be self taught at a variety of disciplines. Still, there is no substitute to hands on learning which is not just sitting behind a computer screen. Also, I think human staff at many places people go to for fun like restaurants, cafes, and museums will always be "in stock" because humans like the warmth and relatability of other humans. I am not worried that artificial intelligence is going to make the average quality of human life go down. I do not see it seriously being a threat to any human, in fact. Automation is not to blame for poverty and job loss. Humans are. It's a matter of distribution of finite resources and understanding how every component of the economy (and ecosystem) is connected at a systems level. Machine intelligence is excellerating humans' ability to comprehend such things. I look forward to a future which gets better with every year for at least the next five thousand years.</span>
