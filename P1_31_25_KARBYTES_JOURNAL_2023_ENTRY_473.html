<p>Even if I achieve the standard of living I fantasize as being most ideal for me (i.e. making lots of money from a job I love which provides me more than enough money to pay for rent in a nice apartment in a nice part of the world where I can live alone and money to pay for all my other necessities and having a robust network of associates who share my professional and hobby-related interests and who I can spend time with and actually feel that it is well worth my time), I would not be too happy if I knew that there were still countries in existence in which people lacked what I consider to be basic human rights (and that includes unconditional access to the Internet, to health care, to the ability to purchase one&#8217;s own food, housing, and the means to travel within the country and to leave the country). I am afraid that women in some middle eastern countries have so little control over their lives that they are practically deprived of bodily autonomy and are forced to be relatively illiterate, brainwashed, and corralled into being very limited in terms of intellectual mobility, physical mobility, and economic mobility. Such women seem to not be allowed to leave the house without a male escort, to be married against their will, to be forced to have sex with her husband against her will, and forced to give birth to as many babies as he basically &#8220;rapes&#8221; her into having (though, in order to preserve her sanity and to avoid getting beaten up or even killed, she would have to feign consent at all times to whatever the patriarchs in her life do).</p>
<p>I was considering adding another prose page to my <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary website</a> in which I define two kinds of philosophical worldviews (not in terms of ontology but, rather, in terms of personal ethics): nihilism and rational optimism.</p>
<p>NIHILISM would be the worldview which states that nothing has inherent value and that a person is not required to categorize any experience or any object as being worthwhile. Instead, a person who I would consider to be a hardcore nihilist chooses to see all things as unconditionally meaningless (which might help those people take the pressure off themselves to pursue goals which they might not be able to achieve and suffer as a result of failing to achieve). A nihilist does not have to be successful at achieving its goals nor does a nihilist have to be blessed with good fortune. Instead, a nihilist does the bare minimum to exist and/or commit suicide. A nihilist pretty much does little more than the bare minimum to get by; the most energy efficient path. I would advocate nihilism for someone who is trapped in tortuous and imprisoning situations like those women in oppressive middle eastern countries.</p>
<p>RATIONAL_OPTIMISM would be the only viable alternative to nihilism which I would condone. Basically, a rational optimist is someone who has ambitious and compelling goals which that person feels is worthwhile for that person to attempt to pursue. Whether or not that person is successful at achieving its goals within a specific finite interval of time, that person is biased towards always believing that it is possible for that person to set meaningful goals and to achieve those goals and that there will never be a shortage of worthwhile goal-oriented activities which that person could do as a means to give that person a sense of control over its own life, a sense of pride at the skills and knowledge it acquires as a result of taking goal-oriented actions, and a sense of reward at being able to attain experiences which would not happen automatically (i.e. if that person just waited for those things to happen to it without taking deliberate proactive steps to make those experiences happen).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I will make a prose page on my primary website about those philosophical positions I just described because such a web page feels a bit too reactionary and &#8220;liberal arts&#8221; instead of science and engineering based. The kinds of prose pages I intend to flesh out on my primary website are articles which describe phenomena such as agency, nature, numbers, and maybe even the multiverse hypothesis. Such things are more &#8220;is&#8221; than &#8220;ought&#8221;. In other words, the so-called philosophical topics I want my primary website to cover are exclusively epistemological and descriptive of real or hypothetical phenomena in nature rather than psychological or emphasizing of human culture. I find &#8220;social justice&#8221; topics to be rather depressing, small-minded, and unsatisfying compared to taking the approach of a relatively impersonal and calmly detached engineer. I would rather write about problems if and only if I have a proposed solution to such problems. Otherwise, I would consider such writing to merely be cathartic (and my <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secondary website</a> is more about catharsis and keeping careful records of my personal growth than it is about great examples of science writing and engineering).</p>
