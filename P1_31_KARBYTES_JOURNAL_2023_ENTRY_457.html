<p>She expects an immediate response from me every time she makes a noise. If I delay giving her a response by even a second, she makes some kind of impatient noise which also sounds demanding. She does not seem to want to have thoughtful conversations nor to cover very many subjects. Instead, she seems to be an infant disguized as a very childish sounding adult who just wants to be constantly affirmed that someone is always there to respond to her, to make her feel perpetually noticed, and to distract her from having to be reminded that things other than her exist and matter to me.</p>
<p>What I just described is the voice I used to refer to as pig_gorl throughout the evolution of this blog. At this time I would rather not assign her any special name and just refer to her as some annoying woman who follows me around seemingly wherever I go and seemingly at all times. She seems to be heckling me quite aggressively and persistently because she wants something from me. I think she wants to be included in what I do but not have to actually function at my level. In other words, I think she wants a free ride using me to do all the heavy lifting physically, mentally, and emotionally for her as though she were literally as helpless, naive, and self-centered as an infant.</p>
<p>She does not seem to approve of me criticizing her and she seems to demand that I treat her as equally deserving of fame, fortune, accolades, inclusion in any and all institutions, and unconditional positive regard. Since she won&#8217;t go away and since she won&#8217;t do anything to make herself anything but an intrusive burden to me, I decided that the best approach for me to take when dealing with her is to treat her like a spoiled little brat girl who is developmentally disabled to the extent that she cannot develop intellectually, emotionally, and socially past a very young age (perhaps seven years old). It would be unethical and unproductive for me to abuse her nor to try to treat her like she is capable of functioning as an adult. Hence, all I can do is carry on with my activities and try my best not to let her take up too much of my finite resources (blog space included).</p>
<p>One of her most recent complaints is that I do not do enough to show that I believe in her potential to do great things. I suppose I am obliged to tell her things which flatter her and which do not impose limitations on her ability to achieve anything she wants to. I suppose I must tell her that she can do anything she sets her mind to but, like (almost) everyone else, she will have probably have to work hard to achieve things which would grant her fame, fortune, and other awards which come only from exhibitting exceptional skill levels.</p>
<p>It seems that she wants to shadow whatever I do and/or have me tell her what to do literally every minute of her life. She seems to have such a short attention span that she interupts me five seconds into responding to her demands. She reminds me of the kinds of patients I have seen in mental hospitals; people who seem to have no ability to quietly focus on an activity without having to talk to whoever is next to them every few seconds.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of that bitch? I do remember taking a hefty amount of psilomethoxin powder earlier this year while laying outside next to an industrial building and having a vivid and visceral hallucination of what looks like the woman I am talking about trying to step into my body and parasitically inhabit it. I felt myself resisting letting her into my body and I saw what her face and body looked like: blonde hair tightly pulled into a bun on the top of her head, short relatively thin body type, and a flush face with squinting eyes and mouth contorted into an expression which looked like a baby crying in a mewling fashion as though to say, &#8220;Let me in!&#8221;. Honestly it was quite creepy and gross. Despite my resistance, she entered my body and I felt her fill my limbs and take over my breathing patterns. I felt her anxiety and tension infiltrate my body like she could not breathe on her own and that she had to steal my oxygen. I would describe the experience as what looked and felt like being posessed by a demon I strongly despise. Perhaps she was designed to exhibit the qualities which I hate most in humans; especially women; people who flaunt their weakness, innocence, neediness, and mental illness as a means to get preferential treatment, forced acceptance into places she is not genuinely wanted, and resources redirected away from others so that she can hog as much of them as possible. She is not just a free loader. Instad, she is someone who is insatiably greedy and demands to have more than everyone else around her.</p>
<p>I do not think she wants to work hard. In fact, I do not think she wants anyone to work hard. She just wants everything to magically get accomplished without any effort expended nor difficulties arising. She seems incapable of spending even a few seconds alone. I think the reason I hallicinated her parasitically invading my body is because she literally has no agency; not even the ability to formulate coherent thoughts. She seems to not know how to do much more than impulsively and glibly react from rote memory. She does not seem to have any goals other than to make sure I keep breathing life into her, giving her a warm body to reside in, and reassuring feedback that everything is going to be alright (for her). I&#8217;m not sure what to do about her unwanted presence in my life other than to just keep going about my business to the best of my ability while she keeps announcing her existence every few seconds.</p>
