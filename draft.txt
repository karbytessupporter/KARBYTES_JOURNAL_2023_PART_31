This is a brief follow-up to my previous journal entry. While walking down the street through a highland residential part of Castro Valley, I thought I heard some hag say from inside her house as I walked by the door of the house which only had the screen door with many little air holes in it closed, "There he goes with his big ego." I might have heard those words transmitted from elsewhere and not whoever was in that house. Regardless of wherever that sound came from, I thought it was important enough to mention in this note because, over and over again for the past few years, I have been seemingly "on trial" and held in bitter contempt from other people for the "crime" of merely "showing off" my intellectual ability. Apparently what I am "supposed to" do is be a lot more humble in my personal expression and choice of hobbies. Apparently I am "supposed to" use smaller, simpler, and more commonly used words and to be much less descriptive when I talk about about anything which is not legally or socially required. Apparently I am not supposed to ever be caught "indulging" in activities which are not quick and easy to learn for most people of most ages because doing so is abilist against people who are "differently abled" and, most of all, because it provokes the insecurities of relatively untalented and relatively uneducated people who have yet to make serious headway towards becoming more than just an amateur at something they want to be professionally good at. Not only is it ablist of me to flaunt my interest and expertise in things other than surviving, sucking cock, and pooping out babies; it is elitist. 

It was suggested to me by the AJP-like voice that many other people are opposed to be flaunting my relatively advanced technical education or artistic/engineering talent because most other people lack the time to do anything other than work full time at grueling jobs which barely pay them enough to pay their rent, utilities, food, medical expenses, clothing, and car maintenance and such people are so tired and so deprived of free time they have "no choice" but to settle for having little more than watching television as their only hobby.

I take that as even more incentive for robots to take over as many (paid) human jobs as possible so that the robots can work tirelessly and without complaint and pay more taxes than what their human counterparts would such that there is sufficient tax money (in addition to redistributing federal expenses such that less money goes towards the military and more goes towards public welfare) to pay for everyone to live on a universal basic income (provided that humans do not give birth to more than two children per womb).
