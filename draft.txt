After charging my electronics (i.e. phone, laptop, and two portable power stations for extending the battery life of my phone and laptop), doing some laundry, drinking coffee, updating my blog, and playing the drums at what I refer to as "base camp" (i.e. my house of legal residence), I headed back out into the wilderness northeast of Lake Chabot to a remote campsite where I intend to make updates to both my primary (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) and my secondary website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com). The time is now 9:40PM Pacific Standard Time.
