Today I revised the web page named PUBLIC_DOMAIN on my primary website to the extent that I think that I will feel no need to ever revise that web page again in the future. I'm quite pleased with that web page and think it sets a good precedent for web pages whose index number on the home page of the encompassing website is larger than one.

On or after 01_AUGUST is when I tentatively plan on getting a full time paid job. Rather than pay rent this year, I tentatively plan on buying backup backpacks, tents, laptops, and other gear I would consider to be essential gear for karbytes. 

Rather than spend myself nearly broke paying to rent a place to legally reside other than where I currently live, I think I will personally get more value out of my money if I spend myself nearly broke in pursuit of my hobbies and in perfecting the art of being a posh hobo. 

Rather than borrow, rent, or buy an automobile (especially a petroleum powered automobile), I plan to commute by walking, bicycling, riding trains such as Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), taxis, shuttle busses, public airlines, and other public transportation methods.
