I found it necessary for my sense of comfort to make clear the following (and I hope that this is the last time I mention the following on this website):

My preferred gender identity is probably best described using the term transman. To me, the word transman seems to have significantly different connotations than FTM.

FTM is an abbreviation of Female To Male and is meant to imply that the person it describes was originally assigned a female sex and decided later on to transition to identifying and presenting oneself as a male..

MTF implies the opposite configuration of an FTM.

Likewise, transwoman is a term which some MTFs refer to themselves as.

I like the term transman and transwoman more than I like those three letter abbreviations because the terms which include man or woman in them clearly specify a gender identity preference. 

As a result of continuously self administering testosterone via intermuscular injections to my thigh muscles, I hope to gain and retain masculine phenotype traits which would not be possible to attain without taking such hormones. (I originally took testosterone from the year 2009 to the year 2010 and quit as a result of fearing that I would not be able to afford nor access continued testosterone. Then, from the year 2011 to 2015 I took estrogen laden and progesterone laden birth control pills which induced femininizing phenotype changes as a result of chemically simulating pregnancy to prevent actual pregnancy. Then, starting around September 2015, I got a non hormonal copper releasing intrauterine device implanted in my cervix as an alternative to chemical birth control and also ceased taking birth control pills. Then, in November 2022, I decided to resume getting back on testosterone and started taking 0.5 milliliters once every two weeks. Then I gradually increased that dose to 0.8 milliliters once every two weeks. I noticed that the bottle prescribed that I take 0.4 milliliters once per week. I am strongly considering switching to that more regular method because it will feel more consistent instead of having what feel like subtle mood and energy swings).

For a while I felt obliged to present myself as a gender non-binary FTM who used the pronouns they/them online but who was and still is referred to by female pronouns by those who I live with and those who are part of my family of origin. I think they secretly disapprove of me taking testosterone and identifying as a transman (or simply man). I get the sense there is a covert war on my masculinity being waged against me by those who think transgenderism is wrong and perhaps because they prefer I be a sweet little girl instead of a relatively macho character. It could be that no one is intentionally trying to discourage my masculine identity nor doing anything else I want to do. I'm just saying this in order to "clear the air" to absolve my own insecurity so that I can move on to addressing newer topics and topics which pertain to my website development goals.
