Today (before 4:00AM) I got the web pages of my primary website whose home page index numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 up to date (but 1 was already up to date and has been since 13_JUNE_2023 and 4 was already up to date and has been since 14_JUNE_2023).

I decided that I will not bother removing social media posts from my social media profiles which link to obsolete web pages of my primary website.

I decided also that I will keep my journaling about personal issues to a bare minimum.

<span style="background:#ffff00">I would like to spend more of my time and energy studying mathematics because working out math problems alters my brain chemistry and makes me feel saner and less agitated. I liken doing math problems to be the mental equivalent of rigorous physical exercise. I ideally want to do both in order to be as smart, strong, sane, and healthy as I can be and to maintain a high degree of physical and mental fitness for the duration of what remains of my life to an extent which is feasible.</span>

Lastly, I thought it would be a good investment for me to subscribe to eventually pay for a pro membership to use the WolframAlfa service because it provides more detailed and mathematically accurate math problem solving functions than chatGPT 3.0 seems to.
