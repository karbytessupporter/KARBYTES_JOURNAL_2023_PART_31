There is seemingly nothing more dreadful to me than the experience of having something personally significant and daunting to undertake which I have not yet completed and might never get around to completing. 

Every day I fear that I will die before I feel that I have finalized my legacy and am genuinely satisfied with it. Despite my fear, I forge ahead anyway and try my best not to let my anxiety become a force of ruin.

At this point I am so motivated to win at my own game that I am willing to forsake consecutive nights of sleep to get milestones done. 

What I am doing specifically will (hopefully) be announced in the next journal entry web page of this website.
