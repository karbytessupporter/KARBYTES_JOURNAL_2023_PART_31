It was brought to my attention that some people are upset at me for choosing to be a transexual male instead of leaving my body unaltered. The people who seem opposed to my transsexualism seem to think that I am "cheating" the (patriarchal) system by giving myself "advantages" which that (patriarchal) system does not condone me having because, if I take testosterone to acquire a manlier phenotype and perhaps even manlier emotions, I am having "too good" of standard of living for my income level relative to what I would presumably be having if I was not a transsexual. 

What seems to upset people a lot in particular is the ease at which I build and maintain muscle mass and the ease at which I keep fat stores from accumulating in the form of prominent tits and ass. Unlike cisgendered women, I probably am less likely to be sexually objectified by men and less likely to be sexually assaulted because I appear to be just another man; not a lucious pair of tits and ass to violate. Also, it seems quite normal in the (patriarchal) system for cisgendered women to be practically forced to be excessively preoccupied with their superficial appearance (which is why they seem more obsessed with weight than others do) and women seem almost too superficial to take their attention off how they are being objectified in the eyes of others and, instead, directing their attention towards doing something immersive and intellectually rigorous.

I suppose I am not doing a very good job of making it look like women have as good of a deal as what men have. In fact, I would say that the culmination of all of my journal entries make me look like a person who thinks women have a shittier deal overall (unless they are wealthy and well taken care of by others who can financially, emotionally, and logistically support them).

I decided to sit down along the road home to update the NUMBERS web page of my primary website because I needed to update my definition of complex numbers. (Mathematics and philosophy seem to pair well in my brain and I find mathematics to be a rich source of inspiration and naturalistic beauty). Sadly, when I turn my focus towards abstract objects instead of staying mired in anthropocentricism and in chauvinism, other people seem to get mad and try to distract me out of my thoughts to resume being "self conscious" about how I physically appear and how I am not doing enough to help keep women sexualized and in subordinate positions by means of not allowing them to do anything gender nonconformist and only talking about them and to them like they are little more than wives, mothers, babysitters, and nurses (and like they are supposed to be too deprived of solitude and personal space and time to develop their intellects so that they could actually keep up with men in science, engineering, and mathematics fields).

Well, I sure hope I did enough to satisfactorially address gender issues. I believe that any person regardless of income could become proficient and even advanced at science, engineering, and mathematics fields given the prevalance of free online study resources. Therefore, what seems to be holding so many people back (especially women) from deeply pursuing such fields is other people in their lives discouraging them and perhaps outright abusing them for the "crime" of doing something other than be a bimbo who never outshines the males in her life (because her life is supposed to revolve around supporting his ego at almost all costs).

Even if I ended up severely disabled or sick, I would do my best to keep studying philosophy, science, engineering, and mathematics in whatever capacity I am able. In order for me to make much headway with that, however, I would probably need to be in contact with friends who are also passionately pursuing and proficient at those interests. Such people would probably help me study and to upkeep my morale because I am one of their peers; not someone to dismiss as a lost cause merely because I lose my senses. There are such things as blind programmers and mathematicians. Such people see with their mind (and as a virtue of studying advanced mathematics, are presumably capable of thinking very deeply and logically about things which most people would only think about at a surface level).
