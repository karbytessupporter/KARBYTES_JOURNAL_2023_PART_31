I stayed up all night because I didn't want to miss my appointment at the doctor's office in San Francisco which I am riding a BART train to at this moment of writing. I have been bullied mercilessly by a snarky and cynical pig_gorl variant since 2AM (which compelled me to write that I think that there are people in my life who are seriously trying to force me to have crippling depression and anxiety as a result of them giving me crippling attention deficit disorder as a means to make me feel diminished and stripped of what makes me feel at home and comfortable in my own skin most: my deeply philosophical mind which uses its own very precise program-like language to communicate with itself and which is blissfully immune to the kinds of misery mongering, shallow, and money obsessed thoughts which that variant of pig_gorl seems to be an adamant proponent of and which seems to keep everyone around me stifled, silenced, and shallow in thought by an oppressive weighted blanket of forced communal dystopic nonchalance and learned aversion to thinking outside the box.

It's not just pig_gorl who I think is on a mission to sabotage my attempts to be happy, healthy, and successful at what I set out to do. I think some other people have been hired to stalk me and bully me in covert ways so that I end up spending more time than I want to hiding outside instead of at home. I think there are people trying to prevent me from benefitting from making as good of use of my resources as I otherwise could out of jealousy and resentment at me for being so self affirming, egotistical, and ambitious instead of humble, passive, and resigned to be more of a nonchalant slave and people person. My bullies often denigrate me for the "crime" of meditating instead of keeping my mind constantly preoccupied with banal, mundane, trite, and uninspiring things and only tepid and crass forms of entertainment. I am afraid that most people I will be dealing with would side with my bullies because my bullies seem to be more populist and anti-elitist and anti-intellectual and anti-introspection and anti-individualist than I am.

Apparently I am getting bullied at least in part because I do not think enough flattering thoughts about working class women who are not as nature-obsessed, science-oriented, and philosophically rigorous as I am (and such people seem to latch onto bickering, high blood pressure mongering animosity, and sadism as their preferred and only form of entertainment). My attempts to be egalitarian, non prejudiced, and humanitarian are unappreciated and discouraged because I am demanded to play misanthrope and nihilist and aimless so that others can ridicule and punish me.

I value myself more than those people do. I seem to value myself far more than any other person has or will. I do not want to value myself less just because I am frequently told by others to "get over myself" and to feel worse.

"You make us feel bad about ourselves, so we try to make you feel bad about yourself. We don't like how you hold onto your self esteem so tightly, so we look for ways to ruin your life so that you suffer in other ways such as forced poverty, being interrupted when you try to pursue your hobbies or study, and being lied to and scammed."
