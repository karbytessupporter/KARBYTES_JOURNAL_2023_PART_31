<hr>
<p>There is seemingly nothing more dreadful to me than the experience of having something personally significant and daunting to undertake which I have not yet completed and might never get around to completing.</p>
<p>Every day I fear that I will die before I feel that I have finalized my legacy and am genuinely satisfied with it. Despite my fear, I forge ahead anyway and try my best not to let my anxiety become a force of ruin.</p>
<p>At this point I am so motivated to win at my own game that I am willing to forsake consecutive nights of sleep to get milestones done.</p>
<p>What I am doing specifically will (hopefully) be announced in the next journal entry web page of this website.</p>
<hr>
<p>I drank a fuck ton of coffee earlier tonight (and used up quite a bit of the bag of ground up Peet&#8217;s coffee beans which I bought from Safeway approximately two days ago). Hence, my anxiety is through the roof (but I like that adrenaline rush and energy boost because it helps me conquer my inner adversaries).</p>
<p>Right now I am hiking through the woods about an hour after midnight. I hear frogs making their characteristic treble-y chirping croaks interspersed with bass-ier and slower sounding growling croaks down by the water&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>The air is quasi tropical yet still cold enough for me to not want to remove my jacket. There is a moderate breeze causing the leaves of the oak trees to rustle loudly and the branches of those trees to move slowly and occasionally creak.</p>
<p>I wanted to elaborate on the note I started earlier in the section above when I was still at my dad&#8217;s house getting ready to head out into the darkness of the nearby wilderness.</p>
<p>Firstly, I think that my &#8220;severe&#8221; existential anxiety about not getting to complete my most cherished projects is a common experience amongst humans throughout all of human history. What I would posit, however, is that my particular variation of existential angst is relatively rare and perhaps the only one of its kind because of the nature of what my most personally significant projects are. Unlike seemingly most other people living in modern developed nations (as opposed to &#8220;third world countries&#8221; and less modernized human civilizations which have ever existed), I seem to have almost zero encouragement nor interested and relevant feedback from other people about my most cherished undertakings. Hence, I imagine that I expend significantly more energy getting things done with respect to my personal goals than I think most humans in &#8220;first world&#8221; countries would. In fact, my sense that other people are unsupportive and even hostile to what I do is so strong that, while high on magic mushrooms during the past year, I felt obliged by tyrannical and impatient others who seemed to outnumber me wherever I went to &#8220;play dead&#8221; and to keep my movements minimal, my breathing shallow, and my thoughts very controlled so as to not get bullied to the extent that I become too incapacitated by discouragement and pain to finish what I set out to do. (Even writing this note feels to me like an invitation to be harassed nonstop and aggressively to the extent that I suffer about as much as I can stand and, hence, feel obliged to make progress towards my goals much more slowly and to be more secretive about my endeavors to avoid getting sabotaged by others).</p>
<p>Secondly, I have decided to take a break from doing psychedelics and from having fun in general (and largely because other people have sabotaged my efforts to have fun quite vehemently in recent years) so that I can focus on getting my rather daunting and intellectually demanding projects accomplished with as minimal suffering as possible. What I learned from some of my most intense shroom trips is that I have a socially unacceptable sense of urgency and single mindedness about the things I want to devote my life to (at least within the next few months if not years) which compels me to want to avoid depending on other people as much as possible and to be rather pessimistic about how they will treat me. I think what I just said sounds very taboo because I have heard other people say that shrooms are about making the ego smaller, more interdependent with others, and less serious about left brain endeavors. I would rather not subscribe to mainstream stereotypes about what shrooms and other psychedelics are &#8220;supposed to&#8221; be used for and try my best to keep more of an impersonal distance from my readers in future blog posts.</p>
<p>(I have found that other people are surprisingly and disappointingly quick to completely disregard what I am trying to make the focus of my thoughts in favor of pushing comparatively banal, shallow, dogmatic, anti-individualistic, and anti-intellectual content. That&#8217;s a major reason why I have dismissed most humans as not being worthy of my time until and unless they become more genuinely supportive or at least non adversarial to my endeavors).</p>
<p>&#8220;No one is gonna wanna support you with an attitude like that,&#8221; one of the pinchy, uptight, sneering peeves of my imagination said to me in response to what I said. &#8220;Hurry up and get whatever you&#8217;re trying to do done or else give up on it right now because you are stressing out people who matter more to society than you do,&#8221; the peeve said. I can tell me and her are not in agreement with each other. I insist on being a perfectionist and taking my time so that I do not end up creating more labor and needless suffering for myself than I have to as a result of rushing in order to appease the demands of an impatient, unkind tyrant who doesn&#8217;t seem to value what I do.</p>
<p>Well, I do not think these writings are very cheerful, but I do think that putting them into written words and sharing them publicly online helps me feel less oppressed and gives me a chance of being better understood by other people.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one owes you compassion nor understanding nor even the right to breathe. It&#8217;s all about survival of the fittest and strength in numbers. If not enough people value your existence, you will be obliterated. Get over it,&#8221; says the peeve.</p>
<p>I do not want to be terrorized into giving up on my cherished personal endeavors just because almost no one shows me any support nor acknowledgement at all about such endeavors.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because other people are too busy having jobs and real lives. To them you look like you have no life and that you need an intervention so that you don&#8217;t just get to keep staying socially isolated in your cocoon and not contributing to other people&#8217;s welfare and not participating in normal society,&#8221; says the peeve.</p>
<p>I imagine many (if not most) humans I would regard as my peers would have already given into that peeve&#8217;s demands. They would have been more willing to go with what she suggests is socially appropriate without much deliberation and without looking back such that, in a few years, those people would boast that they are use to it now and do not miss the more challenging and lonely days of being an iconoclast in an inhospitable cultural environment.</p>
<p>To break the caricature of myself I may have created as a result of writing this section of this note, I honestly do think that I am taking myself a bit too seriously for my taste. I think I am exaggerating how badly other people are opposed to my endeavor and how badly they treat me. If anything, I would imagine most of my critics are just irritated at me for not shutting up and working diligently on my projects sooner instead of fretting about what could go wrong and complaining that other people are preventing me from making progress because they oppose what I do.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too rich to get a job,&#8221; one of the peeves said (and not a very articulate one). I do not want to get a job simply to make brats like her stop bullying me. Past experience has shown me that having a job does not stop people like her from harassing me. I suspect people like her want me to get a job solely so that I am prevented from having a more satisfying life than what they typically have. Such people do not seem to be concerned with whether or not I make a meaningful contribution to society or do work that is even necessary. For them, low-paying, time-consuming, and politics-laden &#8220;busy work&#8221; will do. Perhaps that is the only kind of work they approve of me doing. Well, fuck them. I think I can find something better to do with my time.</p>
<hr>
<p>I imagined reaching the end of my life in old age and dying a slow and agonizing death as a result of preventable disease hastened by the negligence and socially normal cruelty of nursing home caregivers. I imagine having so few lasting human connections and so few humans championing my causes throughout my life that, unlike my more socially-connected and socially-supported counterparts, I would be relegated to the shittiest parts of the elder care business and essentially be treated as an unwanted and despised burden by others.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t my fear of getting mistreated, maligned, and neglected in old age spur me to more urgently ingratiate myself to others as their servant and ally? No. Quite the opposite. I resent the idea of me being subservient and unconditionally loyal to others just so that I do not get treated by my fellow humans as a &#8220;lost cause&#8221;.</p>
<p>What makes me feel much safer and more satisfied and in control of my life than depending on others is striving to be as self reliant and hardy as possible. That&#8217;s something I seem to do which most others do not (and that&#8217;s probably a major reason why other people seem to be showing me contempt for &#8220;showing off&#8221; how good I am at being self reliant and comfortable with spending almost all of my life in solitude and in the absence of people I know, trust, and feel valued by).</p>
<p>Again, to break out of that sniveling caricature of the bitter iconoclast I may have accidentally resurrected with this journal entry section, I often feel quite harmonious in the midst of other people in the sense that we can peacefully cohabitate on the same planet in the same region of that planet with no obvious conflicts arising. I also want to add that I generally do not feel safe carrying a lethal weapon nor carrying myself in a manner which suggests that I expect to engage in violent combat with other humans. I want humans to feel safe in my midst and to believe that I harbor zero intent to inflict violence on anyone except for in rare cases in which I need to protect myself or someone else from a violent attacker.</p>
<p>The coyotes are squealing and howling in unison loudly in the forest next to me. Now it&#8217;s just the sound of creaking branches, rustling leaves, and distant train horns. Now comes the sound of a lone owl hooting. I also just now noticed crickets chirping. Then some raccoons made some chittering sounds as they scampered through the bushes. Frogs croaking come and go in waves. The forest is clearly teeming with life.</p>
<hr>
<p>I would like to add a few more thoughts before closing this note.</p>
<p>I was thinking about some things I have witnessed a lot over the past few years which I seem to be the only person seriously disturbed by: the way many people use deliberately cruel or physically coercive and intrusive and dishonest tactics to force me to do what those people want which I do not readily consensually do.</p>
<p>Metaphorically speaking, it&#8217;s like holding a gun up to my head and telling me to do something while telling me that what they are doing to me is morally correct because what they are doing is ensuring I do what they think is morally correct.</p>
<p>As unpopular as my opinion might sound, I think that society is generally a less violent, less crime ridden, and happier place for everyone in it if everyone in those societies is properly educated from a young age, not forced to live in squalor and in overcrowded spaces, exposed to natural environments sufficiently regularly instead of solely human-terraformed artificial environments, and expected to simply care about helping other people because doing so makes society a nicer place for everyone to live in as opposed to expecting people to be too selfish and too base to voluntarily be kind and helpful to others (especially people who are not members of their close-knit communities) and hence justifying that people be coerced into &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>I heard a quote which I generally believe is true: people rise to the level of their expectations. What that means in this context is that, if we expect people to generally not cheat or be belligerent assholes, people&#8217;s subconscious minds are not seeded with expectations that they are implicitly &#8220;supposed to&#8221; lie, cheat, steal, or engage in violence as a norm rather than as an exception.</p>
<p>Rather than try to inspire a bunch of angry monkeys to reform their behavior and to be more civil in their conduct, I would rather avoid getting involved in the affairs of short-tempered, banal-minded hot heads because they lack the attention span, patience, and open mindedness necessary to appreciate what I have to say (until perhaps long after those people get to seriously decompress, not be in such perpetual fight-or-flight mode, and have consistently better standards of living first). Meanwhile, in order to provide a better standard of living for such people, I would rather associate with and collaborate with people who are already invested in promoting my values. That&#8217;s a way of choosing the path of least resistance (i.e. to not force alliances between myself and people who seem too different in terms of cultural background, moral values, and education specialization to have relatively effortless and mutually enjoyable collaborations).</p>
<p>The Internet in general is my lifeline when it comes to finding and interacting with sufficiently like minded people. I&#8217;m not much of a socialite, but I do think I socialize enough to be a decent citizen (though I imagine many people would disagree and say that I need to have more in-person relationships to be considered a functional or even decent member of society).</p>
