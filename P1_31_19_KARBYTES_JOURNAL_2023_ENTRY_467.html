<p>The real zombie apocalypse is what I call the asshole disease (which appears to be contagious). When one is surrounded by assholes, one is simply expected to succumb to becoming just another asshole. I have fallen ill with the disease at times but not enough to seriously be infected to my core. I have been trying not to turn into an asshole despite being frequently engulfed by assholes who seem to be chasing me around, stalking me, and sabotaging my fun so that I give up on being a cool person and, instead, settle for being an uncool person so that I can survive in the midst of tyrannical assholes who seem to monopolize the world and hastening the decline of civilization. Even though the prospects of the human species seems bleak as a result of that fact that the assholes are extremely numerous and momentous and set in their ways, I nevertheless try to make the most of the fear years left I have to live turning away from the cynical, belligerent, misery mongering assholes and towards the relatively few non assholes; the only people who don&#8217;t seem to squander and human potential which took evolution millions if not billions of years to erect only to be squandered within less than one hundred years following the industrial revolution. I operate on larger time frames than the assholes who seem to think humans only existed for a few hundred years and mostly with the trappings bestowed by the industrial age. Just because other people are assholes does not necessarily mean that I will become an asshole, but it will probably mean that I will never be nearly as happy and healthy as I thought I would be. In order for humanity to not squander its abundance of resources and knowledge and abilities in the madness of modernity, a huge critical mass of humans would need to be sufficiently &#8220;woke&#8221; instead of sleepwalking while apparently awake in a trance driven by insecurity and animosity.</p>
<p>This is just propaganda from beyond. I am merely channeling someone else&#8217;s messages such that they may be delivered to you. That&#8217;s all the tabloids I have to share for now. I hope this helps.</p>

<p>I think I wrote this piece to externalize some kind of ugly person I accidentally internalized; a very insufferable, impatient, controlling, jealous, shallow, insecure baby; a guy who acts like he is oh so misunderstood and underappreciated and stubbornly in a fowl mood because of how slighted he feels even by things which were not intended to make him feel bad such as me simply living my life pursuing my hobbies and going on adventures alone instead of being a miserable, crazy do-nothing like how he seems to go out of his way to force me to be.</p>
<p>It seems that many people treat that brat like he deserves to be the center of my life and that I should just do whatever he wants (and then those people think I am being a villain for simply wanting to go my own way instead of be his slave and abuse victim). Instead of focusing on maths (which is supposed to be for him and not for me to enjoy), I should instead be playing dumb so as to not cause him and others distress.</p>
<p>This is trash to put an end to the spawning of more trash. I hope it works.</p>

<p>I had fun walking around in San Francisco today and observing the party-like atmosphere in the streets. I appreciated being able to see the many people around me. It felt like being in a giant play full of lively characters who seemed surprisingly outgoing and unpretentious. It was refreshing.</p>
<p>I am afraid to share the good news of my life because of people like that belligerent, uptight, killjoy baby I referred to in the previous section. I think that person stalks me night and day and is extremely opposed to me having fun (but he sure acts like he is the king of living the good life, being cool, being in the know, and having nice things). I remember him seeming to pick fights with me because he did not want us to both have a good time. He seemed to only have a good time if and only if I was having a bad time (especially if he helped to make my bad time bad or worse).</p>
<p>I bet a lot of people think he is doing me a favor by giving me a villain to bitch about because those people think I do not have enough going on in my life and not enough to do and that I need petty drama to keep me entertained. This note is starting to come full circle. The assholes in my life seem to get provoked into wanting to upset me whenever I simply have a good time by myself and am on what I consider to be good behavior. I wonder if those assholes are deliberately trying to torture me into retaliating in a hostile manner just so that they can get their jollies off and also have an excuse to retaliate against me with more fighting; endless fighting; the ultimate substitute for hobbies and personal accomplishments; something which requires no skill and which is very socially acceptable and popular to engage in.</p>
<p>I have been voluntarily celibate mainly because I have no interest in mating with assholes. Also, my masturbation sessions (which lately happen only a few times a month and sometimes less than once a month) are sufficient to scratch my itch for sexual gratification and after I orgasm, I immediately see how underwhelming sex really is and how grossly over-hyped it is in culture.</p>
<p>Maybe I should keep all my fun experiences (sex and masturbation included) on the down low so as to not upset the people who get very irate over the idea of me having fun without their permission and for having positive, uplifting, inspiring, and wholesome experiences (because I am apparently only supposed to be perpetually gloomy, depressed, and painfully desperate for breathing space).</p>
<p>How many people fool themselves into thinking that what they want is the love of some other primate when what they really want is autonomy and a deeper connection to nature and transcendent experiences which can only be experienced in solitude?</p>
<p>Solitude seems to be the most controversial and secretly lusted for commodity which people want but have to pretend is the devil to want. People are practically raped into being trite, stupid, and weak because other people deprive them of the chance to become more autonomous and rational.</p>
