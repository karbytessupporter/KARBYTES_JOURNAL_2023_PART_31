<p>After charging my electronics (i.e. phone, laptop, and two portable power stations for extending the battery life of my phone and laptop), doing some laundry, drinking coffee, updating my blog, and playing the drums at what I refer to as &#8220;base camp&#8221; (i.e. my house of legal residence), I headed back out into the wilderness northeast of Lake Chabot to a remote campsite where I intend to make updates to both my primary (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) and my secondary website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>). The time is now 9:40PM Pacific Standard Time.</p>

<p>While walking I was thinking about something I have written about in past journal entries and that I would like to reiterate in clearer terms: <span style="background:#ffff00">as medical technology advances, human lifespans will likely have the capacity to be extended orders of magnitude what they currently are (but only if the following measures are taken): most humans will need to prioritize extending individual human lifespans over maintaining or increasing human population size (and most humans will need to need to believe that allowing scientific and technological research and development to continue with minimal obstruction is far more beneficial to humanity than detrimental).</span></p>
<p>I think that many humans rather automatically react in opposition to what I suggested because such people believe that allowing technology to become any more advanced than it currently is will (a) enable artificial intelligence to become too smart and powerful for humans to control, (b) that such artificial intelligence will enslave, harm, or kill humans, (c) upset God and His ordained societal order because He does not like it when humans &#8220;play God&#8221; and make God feel ignored, replaced, diminished, and disobeyed, and (d) cause widespread existential anxiety and despair in humans who are strongly attached to and dependent on the tradition of the rite of passage which entails getting married to a suitable partner of the opposite sex as soon as possible and sexually reproducing to create as many offspring as possible within the context of that monogamous relationship and church and state sanctioned institution called marriage.</p>
<p>I would like to elaborate on point d in the previous paragraph by saying that I think many humans are not sufficiently concerned with the welfare of any being other than themselves, their spouses, and their minor children (which means that such people do not think about how their actions impact the world outside that limited spatial and temporal scope (which means that such people are likely to contribute to overpopulation and to harming Earth&#8217;s ecosystem)). Such people probably console themselves with the belief that they and their loved ones will be whisked away to eternal paradise and be reunited in the afterlife where that paradise exists (which means that it is a waste of their time to try saving Earth&#8217;s ecosystem from becoming inhospitable to future human inhabitants).</p>

<p>I imagined someone strongly objecting to me sharing the thoughts I wrote in the previous section to the general public (especially in written form) under the justification that such communications are harmful to some people&#8217;s mental health. I imagine someone wanting to file a lawsuit against me for publishing notes online to a general audience which caused that person to feel suicidally depressed and to lose income as a result of having to call out sick or to be hospitalized. I have almost no money and very few material assets which that person could have confiscated from me as payment for the damages I caused them. Hence, I imagined that the court ordered to have my websites censored from the public Internet and for me to be forbidden from publishing content online in the future as punishment for the harm I caused as an influencer on the Internet and as a means to prevent future harm resulting from sensitive minds encountering information which seriously traumatizes them and causes them to miss work and suffer deteriorating health.</p>
<p>I also imagined some guys wearing ski masks sneaking up on me in the dark and gouging out my eyes with knives (and possibly inflicting crippling injuries on me in other ways) as a means to punish me for the crimes I imagined getting sued for, jailed for, and revoked of (at least some of) my First Amendment rights for (because those guys wanted to take the enforcement of justice into their own hands and be heroes to their fragile minded women).</p>
<p>(Writing these rather disturbing thoughts down and sharing them with the general public online and doing everything in my power to preserve those records on the public web (especially by backing up all of my blog posts to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a>) makes me feel better and I can easily imagine someone else (especially a young person who recently graduated high school) finding my blog and feeling comforted by reading thoughts which are similar to their own and which they might have not had the chance to articulate themselves or which they have been afraid to admit out of fear of being socially ostracized).</p>
<p>I imagine someone suggesting to me that I put a warning on my public websites that my content is not suitable for minors and that my content may contain content which is inappropriate for some people to view (and that I should require visitors to my websites to acknowledge such warnings and to click a button which indicates that they read those warnings and consent to such warnings and understand that entering my website could be detrimental to their mental health).</p>
<p>It is a bit late to add that feature to my websites. I would rather just leave it sitting online for anyone to find whether or not anyone who visits my websites gets &#8220;hurt&#8221; from my &#8220;dangerous&#8221; content. I suppose that makes me very selfish and a danger to society (but I also think that any person should be allowed to publish whatever information they want to online regardless of the social or legal consequences because it is a way to transmit and to preserve information which might otherwise not proliferate).</p>
<p>Finally, if what I say online disturbs you or <span style="background:#ffff00">if you are in serious emotional distress (especially if you are considering harming yourself or others or doing anything drastic and irreversible such as committing suicide or destroying property), I recommend you seek professional help immediately. Here are some mental health hotlines, chat rooms, and other resources you can take advantage of immediately: <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines</a></span></p>
<p>I am sorry it has come to this. I hope you find lasting relief to your suffering. I am sorry I could not be there for you as a better friend. I have too many problems of my own and am too selfish and conceited to give back to society in more helpful and socially valued ways.</p>

<p>I noticed very intricate bird vocalizations from many different species of birds occurring simultaneously around sunrise (but before and after that period of the day/night cycle, the birds are relatively quiet) in the region I have been camping at during the past two weeks. It&#8217;s quite a &#8220;magical&#8221; phenomenon to behold. I tentatively plan on making a brief video recording of that sunrise birdsong period and uploading that video to Instagram and GitHub and sharing a link to that GitHub video file in a journal entry web page on this website. Doing so would be a means of preserving memories of my <u>Summer Camp by Karbytes</u> experience which may otherwise be lost in time. Also, sharing such a video helps to expose more people to things they might not have the opportunity to experience firsthand (and it might compel them to take a greater appreciation for and interest in protecting biodiversity on Planet Earth).</p>
