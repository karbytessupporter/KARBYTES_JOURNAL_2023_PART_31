I noticed very intricate bird vocalizations from many different species of birds occurring simultaneously around sunrise (but before and after that period of the day/night cycle, the birds are relatively quiet) in the region I have been camping at during the past two weeks. It's quite a "magical" phenomenon to behold. I tentatively plan on making a brief video recording of that sunrise birdsong period and uploading that video to Instagram and GitHub and sharing a link to that GitHub video file in a journal entry web page on this website. Doing so would be a means of preserving memories of my Summer Camp by Karbytes experience which may otherwise be lost in time. Also, sharing such a video helps to expose more people to things they might not have the opportunity to experience firsthand (and it might compel them to take a greater appreciation for and interest in protecting biodiversity on Planet Earth).
