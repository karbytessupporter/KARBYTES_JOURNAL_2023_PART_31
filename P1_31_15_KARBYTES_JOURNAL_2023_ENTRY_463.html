<p>Between 6:00AM and 8:00AM I recorded the following videos of wild animal noises while I was in my tent in the forest northeast of Lake Chabot:</p>
<p>What I like about the first video is the the fact that a small bird landed on the top of the tent and ate the caterpillar which was crawling up there (at 1:25 to 1:28). I also like the way two crows were vocalizing at the same time such that when one was quiet the other was emitting a sound (at 1:20 to 1:24).</p>
<p>What I like about the second video is the way I can hear the crows traveling away from my location by the way the loudness of their vocalizations gradually decreased.</p>
<p>What I like about the third video is the way a squirrel makes a few monosyllabic utterances with pauses between them followed by a crescendo of loud chittering followed by shorter quieter vocalizations with more pauses in between them (at 34 to 46).</p>
